## Getting Started

Flowinance is running its database on Supabase. Supabase allows you to run a local instance, so you don’t have to worry about breaking the production database. First, we are going to configure Supabase locally, following the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) that Supabase provides. In this example, we will do it using a Mac, but check their documentation for adapting it to your operating system.

1. Install the Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   ```
2. The Supabase CLI uses Docker containers to manage the local development stack. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
3. Run Docker.
4. Run Supabase locally:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```
5. Once all of the Supabase services are running, you'll see output containing your local Supabase credentials. Copy them into your `.env.local` file:

   ```bash
   Started supabase local development setup.

           API URL: http://localhost:54321
           DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
       Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
       Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
           anon key: eyJh......
   service_role key: eyJh......
   ```

6. You can check Supabase studio at http://localhost:54323
   <p align="center">

   </p>

   When you are finished working on your Supabase project, you can stop the stack:

   ```bash
   supabase stop
   ```

7. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
8. Flowinance uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for handling the types and migrations of the database. If this is the first time you are setting up the project, generate the tables for your Supabase local instance:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
   > You may get an error `Environment variable not found: DATABASE_URL`. To fix it, run:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres"
   ```
9. That's it! 🎉 Run Flowinance's development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
