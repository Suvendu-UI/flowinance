# Contributing to Flowinance

We are glad that you are interested in contributing to our open source project!

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines
1. Make sure the change runs successfully locally
2. Consider if the change affects `README.md`
3. In your commit message's subject (50 char length at max), you should succinctly describe what changes this commit introduces
4. A commit shouldn't take more than 100 lines of code. You will write your contribution faster and the person who will review your code will appreciate it.

When opening a PR, consider the reviewer's time: briefly describe the changes by completing the PR template (it will be automatically generated when you open the PR, so no need to worry 😉).

## 📑 Installation
Please follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/manuelalferez/flowinance/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to install and run the project.

If you have any problem and need help to configure the project, feel free to open a new discussion in the [Discussions](https://github.com/manuelalferez/flowinance/discussions) section, your question helps us to improve the documentation.  

Happy coding! 🎉
